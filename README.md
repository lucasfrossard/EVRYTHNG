# EVRYTHNG
Playing with EVRYTHNG API (www.evrythng.com)

Evrythng is a platform for supporting the internet of things.

On this example, I've used their product API and their scanning capabilities. I haven't done a deep dive on that API. I just made some calls to test their API very briefly.

#SCAN

Trying their scanning function, I have tried two differente approaches. The first n I would just upload a picture, and on the second one I would take a snapshot using the webcam.

To get this snapshot I have used the wemcam.js library provided by jhuckaby available at: https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs

I hope this code can help you if need to try EVRYTHNG API.

Have fun!
